    <h2>Most famous cocktail in the world</h2>

    <p>The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it was invented in New York Cityâ€™s Manhattan Club, some time around 1880 (as the story goes). Over the years, the whiskey classic has dipped in and out of fashion before finding its footing as one of the cornerstones of the craft cocktail renaissance.</p>
