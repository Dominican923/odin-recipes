# Cocktail Recipes Page
A test website displaying 3 famous Cocktail recipes.

The purpose of the website is showcasing what I've learned during The Odin Project's HTML Foundations course.

The course included basic knowledge of using git and the fundamental skills of building a website using HTML. It's nothing fancy, nothing actually usable as a website, just a way to express I'm able to build a functional basic HTML website, using HTML boilerplate and a few tags.
